//---------------------------The User's Name--------------------------
//This .dic file has to do with setting the user's name and suffix/prefix. You may recall some of the functions mentioned here from bootend.dic. As you can see, you can spread functions across multiple .dic files if you like! Just remember my note in bootend.dic about the different between OnFunction and Function.

//This file is fairly short, so don't worry! It shouldn't take you too long to finish.

//Make sure to read the walkthrough (http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/walkthrough.html) for more details about how to properly format ghost dialogue!
//I will reiterate that you should be editing these in Notepad++, and in particular, you should set the Language to C (or Java I guess) to properly highlight all the text. It will make things A LOT EASIER for you, trust me! It will also help you keep track of your brackets in case you forget some. If you click on a line with a bracket in Notepad++, it should highlight where the other bracket ends, or turn purple if there's no finishing bracket (which you should definitely fix!)
//It will also highlight my commented lines in green, so you'll know where they are. Any line beginning with // is a commented line that the code will not read. It's just for your reference!


//--OnTeachName
//This is called from the config menu in the main character's double click menu when the user says they want to change their name. If you look in menu.dic you'll see the code leading to here.

OnTeachName	
{
	if reference0 == "TEACHNAME" //ignore this
		{
		"\0\s[0]¿Quieres que te llame de otra manera? \w6No hay problema.\![open,inputbox,OnNameTeach,-1]\e"
		//This is the bit of dialogue you can rewrite if you want. Note that this line ends with \![open,inputbox,OnNameTeach,-1]. You may recognize this from bootend.dic. Essentially, this will lead to the next function. Make sure you don't delete that tag! The rest you can do whatever with though.
		}
	else
		{
		//This else statement is empty, and I'm mostly pointing this out to mention that you can do this too with your if/elses if you want! An empty else will simply cause your ghost not to do anything. I wouldn't get too crazy with this though.
		}
}


//--OnNameTeach
//This is where the user inputs their name and the ghost analyzes it. If you want your ghost to have specific responses to certain names, this is where you would add them. If not, you can erase all the way from the initial if down to the else statement, only leaving from ""\0\s[0]Do you want a title?" to "\![*]\q[-san,titlesan]\e". So it'd look something like

//OnNameTeach
// {
	//tempname = reference0
	
//"\0\s[0]Do you want a title?\w4\n\n[half]\![*]\q[Nope,titlenone]\n"
	//	--
	//	if presuffix == "masculine"
	//	{
	//	"\![*]\q[Mr.,titlemr]\n/
	//	\![*]\q[Master,titlemaster]\n"
	//	}
	//	elseif presuffix == "feminine" 
	//	{
	//	"\![*]\q[Ms.,titlems]\n/
	//	\![*]\q[Lady,titlelady]\n"
	//	}
	//	-- 
	//	"\![*]\q[-ssi,titlessi]\n/
	//	\![*]\q[-san,titlesan]\e"
// }

//If you did so. Otherwise, just fill things the next things as you like.
